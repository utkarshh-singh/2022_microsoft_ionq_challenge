# iQuHACK 2022 - The Quantum Maze

2 Player_ludo Game
Rules: 
Our dice has only 4 options: 1, 2, 3, 4
If you get 4, then only you can leave your home. 
Other rules are the same. 
##One trick is the position of boxes A and B is not fixed. They can be in any box in between the numbers 9 and 20. 
##Only after a measurement, we’d know for sure. 
##We should be in either box A or B to win the game
…..
Another ending could be:
We put a Bloch sphere in place of A and B.
And when a player reaches the nearest box, he has to rotate the Bloch sphere by using any quantum gate to make it in 0 states.
