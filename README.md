# iQuHACK 2022 - The Quantum Maze

The Quantum Maze is a classical ludo inspired maze game that allows beginners to delve into the basic concepts of different quantum gates. The dice roll is symbolised as a quantum measurement of a circuit with two hadamard gates. The winning   move involves applying a suitable quantum gate to a bloch sphere to bring it back to state 0. It is a two player game with both of them playing alternatively to reach the winning destination.

### Rules
- We have a four-face dice. One can start the game only when we land at a four by a quatum measurement of two hadamard gates.
- We should be in either box A or B to win the game. We put a Bloch sphere in place of A and B. And when a player reaches the nearest box, he has to rotate the Bloch sphere by using any quantum gate to land it in 0 state.
